# Gameplay

## General

After selecting your ideal cheat, setting up your HvH config, and want to try out If this is your first time to try HvH, you might be overwhelmed by a lot of concepts in the HvH scene, like 1 ways, epeek, stack and so on.

## Concepts

In fact, the core copncept of HvHing in CSGO falls to the common idea of HvH: the race to be the fastest people to make damage to other players while trying to protect yourself from doing so. In short, all you need to do is to treat HvH as a movement game, and trying to move to positions that advatnages you.

## Matchmaking HvH vs Community HvH servers

There are some differences from community hvh and matchmaking hvh games. In community HvH it's more about your movement and the use of exploits, while in matchmaking you have the consider more items, including economy, team collaberation and the use of nades.

In community hvh, there are expolits \(doubletap, hide shots\) that could give you insane advantage when playing HvH. Also AWPs are banned in a lot of these community servers since it is too broken.Besides, community mostly will provide all maxium money at round start, this could allow players to train for their playstyle with autosnipers or scouts.

However in matchmaking HvH, there are more events that requires to take account for. The most critical part is the economy. Without any exploits \(Which there are, but not as useful as in community HvH servers\), making every shot you make could made a difference. Hence, the AWP would be the recommended weapon when playing matchmaking HvH. Having CSGO economy knowledge would give you advantages. If you run a good economy strategy, you could make a comeback even you lose in the beginning. Secondlly, unless you are playing with your friends, you will often finding you are the only cheater in your team while the enemy team got multiple cheaters. Thus this will require teamwork and strong communication on economy and throwing nades at the right timing. This is not something required in community hvh servers.
