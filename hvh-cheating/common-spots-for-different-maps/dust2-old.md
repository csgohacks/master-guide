# Dust2 \(Old\)

Here we will cover the common spots for HvHing in dust 2 (Old).

## A long

### Pit

* Type: 1 way
* Against: A site (Visible part) + Bedroom + Car
* Possible to defeat?: No

Holding pit whilst fakeducking on dust 2 (Old) if played correctly is one of if not the best 1 way present on this map. Its a simple angle to hold and can fetch you alot of kills on newer players who rush pit every round. Playing this postion against more knowledgable people is harder however still possible. You will commonly find people throwing HE grenades or molotov's at you, As soon as they start throwing nades throw wait 1-2s then throwdown a smoke this ensures that you don't take that much damage but have the smoke last longer. In the process of throwing the smoke people will push you (most of the time) and give you a chance to fakeduck, move up and get some kills.
