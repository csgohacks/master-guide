# Tips for legits

## Tips for closet legit players

Some features you should use:

## Radar hack

Radar hack is better than regular ESP because it allows you to expect players, but not exactly where they are.

## Sound ESP

Sound ESP is much better than regular ESP because you only see it if the player is making noise. This means you know a player is there, however don't peek directly onto their head because the sound isn't that precise and it can be blatant.

## Lose rounds!

Voluntarily die against bad players! In rounds where you're up by a handful, lose. In 14-14 rounds, it's okay to go a little harder. Lose unimportant rounds.

## Practice movement!

This is why people call you out most of the time. Silver movement, Global aim. Just hack barely enough to win at your rank. No more.

## When using Esp/Glow dont make it obvious

One of the most suspicious thinge in the world is when an agressive player suddenly stops infront of a door, and *somehow* an enmy walks through. It will almost always get you overwatched. sometimes its okay to run through a door and get shot. it should be obvious, but this is one of the things that overwatch ban the most

## Other small tidbits to keep in mind

-Keep triggerbot and other blatant cheats to a minimum or simply dont use them

-If a cheat that you are using aldready has a legit config, look into it, see its keybinds, and pre-enabled modules that you may not need. dont just use a config blindly 

-Ask people you know if you look legit. if they say you dont, its time to change settings

-If you know someone is cheating on the other team, dont engage in legit HvH, at least try not to. try and bitch loud enough that they get overwatched

-If someone is cheating on your team. make sure you have lower settings than them, so people only suspect the other player
