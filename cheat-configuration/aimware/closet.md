# Closet Cheating

Closet cheating is the most legit looking method of cheating. In most cases closet cheaters dont use ESP/Chams and resort to only using a low FOV legit bot, as this basicaly guarenttes you wont be caught by overwatch (If you do it well).

The basics to closet cheating with aimware are the following:

Only use ESP/Chams if you are confident in you being able to resist the urge to look aim at people through walls.
Never use low smoothing on your legit bot, and never use a trigger bot.
