### Opinions ahead!

* The following section is only from the users who used aimware as their major cheating software, however theese only should taken as references only.
* All theese testimonials does not represnt the offical statment of the r/csgohacks subreddit.

### Legitbot

* Highly adjustable option, which means will take time to configure
* Smooth aimbot
* Dymanic triggerbot

### Ragebot

* Anti-Aim is wacky, however a recent update brings a god-like anti-aim method to aimware. --TODO
* Reslover is extremely un-optimized, causing FPS drop often.

### Visuals

-- TODO: Insert ESP demo

* Information-rich ESP \(Hostages, C4, dropped weapons, etc\)
* Highly customizable option, which means will take time to configure
* Charms are not very favourable by most users.

### Miscellaneous

* Skinchanger and Modelchanger are available. \(Modelchanger requires bypass `sv_pure`\)
* A feature-rich LUA API which users can create their LUA scripts to customize the cheat's behaviour 
* Cannot use `sv_cheats 1` command in csgo without turing off Anti-Untrusted in Miscellaneous
* A live LUA editor is available in v5.

### Config

* In .cfg file format, However not text-editable.
* Config files are located at a generated folder with random text at %appdata%
* LUAs are in .lua file format as a normal LUA script, text-editable

### Services

* Moderators barely reply
* False bans happened often
* HWID resets take days or more, while not 100% gurantee success.

  > The staff is probably the worst part about the cheat, they often don't know what they are doing and are known to ignore HWID resets for no reason, the staff will claim that the resolver is perfect and is known for "config issue /thread closed" and they are known to ban quite easily, so be careful with the staff. ---[u/manofeverything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Csgohacks/comments/farrad/i_need_your_feedback/fj03tnh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

### Overall

* Decent legitbot
* Improved ragebot
* Meh Visuals
* Feature-rich miscellaneous options
* Bad customer services
* Still worthy for a lifetime subscription for it's name and stability.

--TODO-- Insert more opinions about aimware.

## Prerequisites

* According to their website, there is not any extra prerequisites to use the cheat itself.
