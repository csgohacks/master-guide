# Pastes and scams

These are some cheats that have been identified as scams, so just stay away from them.



## DarkAim

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, InsanityCheats and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, vac detected and receives nearly zero updates.

## InsanityCheats

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, Darkaim and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, sometimes vac detected and receives some updates. The staff team is alot better with this one out of the jme pastes.

## IWantCheats

Lying about permanent detections in multiple games.

## Singularity.wtf

Fake-Reviews, Fake-Infos

## Icheat.io

Pasted by jme, Vac detected like his other pastes,  half of its features are buggy and broken and it rarely receives any updates from its dev anymore.

## DeadlyCheats

Pasted from another cheat, They ended up recoding the cheat for a v2 with a new dev, Even with the recode its still vac detected with buggy broken features.

## 420cheats

Little features for the price, dev couldn't give two flying ducks about the cheat (thats why its pasted), detected often and make sure to stay away from the free cheat as its so broken and nearly as detected as ezfrags.

## Omniaim

Bought their loader off of someone, Staff don't care about the cheat at all, Rarely receives updates and it's detected quite often.

## 5dollarcheats

Fake-Reviews, Vac detected very often and the dev doesn't care about the project.

## Redeye Cheats

Used to be a jme paste, Used to have the dev that worked on Darkaim, InsanityCheats and Abyss, Previous dev has sold pastes before, Now has a new dev but its still paste, not a very good detection record and they've tried to redeem themselves but its still pasted with a few of its features being broken.

## abyss.gg

A jme paste, same dev that works on Darkaim, InsanityCheats used to work on RedeyeCheats, Dev has sold pastes before, Vac detection issues, Receives nearly zero updates and a non-existent staff team/a team that doesn't care.

## Ezfrags

Ezfrags is technically not a paste, but with it's high detection it is not recommended to use.

Plus we do not recommend people buying Ezfrag's premium subscription, since it is just the same as Ezfrag's free version, but ironically it has a highly detection rate than the free version. So just stay away from both Ezfrag's plan.

## Project Infinity

Project Infinity also has a free version, but since it has been identified as being pasted from singularity, we do not recommend you to try it out.

## Zapped

Zapped.cc is a highly controversial cheat provider that has been claimed to leaking it's user's ip address, causing user's online privacy might be compromised. Also according to [Boring](pastes-and-scams.md), a famous cheating youtuber, who has pointed out several evidence about zapped that it is a scam. However since we cannot validate the accuracy of his sources, we are still unable to give a conclusion as of right now, but until then it will still be on the paste and scam list.
