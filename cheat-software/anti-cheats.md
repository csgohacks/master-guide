# Anti-Cheats

## General

Here we will introduce some common anti-cheats for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive \(CSGO\). There are the most common anti-cheat: VAC \(Valve Anti-Cheat\) and other league cheats. In general, league cheats are more harder to bypass and way more expensive while cheats that are aimed to bypass VAC are way more cheaper, while the bypass methods are more easier.

## VAC \(Valve Anti-Cheat\)

Valve Anti-Cheat is the default anti-cheat software used in CSGO. \(TODO: remove all the content after this setence in VAC section,don't trust anything in VAC introduction!\) Which uses signature detection to detect whether a program is modifiying the memory address for CSGO. Most cheating software introduced here are aimed to bypass VAC with different methods.

## VAC vs VACNET

A lot of people get confused about VAC and VACNET, thinking they are the same stuff, which in fact isn't.

VAC is an anti cheat. It detects cheats on your computer. It's generally not very secure.

VACNET is an "AI" system that can detect cheaters. It is generally only effective against spin botters. It recently had an update that stated there will be less spin botters in overwatch. Whether this means they will insta ban afterwards or it requires less confirmations, no one is sure.

## ESEA Anti-Cheat

ESEA Anti Cheat is a client sided Anti Cheat that is pretty strong, meaning there are not that many cheats out for it and they are like cheats for Faceit client side really expensive.
\(More info needed\)

## FACEIT server side

Faceit server side is less secure than client side. It detects anti aim, certain types of aimbot, and rage bot, and other manipulations like backtrack. However, many p2c's do indeed support server side; for example, skeet. Ratpoison is a free cheat that does as well.

## FACEIT client side

Faceit client side is incredibly hard and expensive to bypass correctly. Expect to spend several hundred monthly \(and still no guarantee of 100% undetectedness\) because this anti cheat is well written. Also, if they ban you for cheating on client side, they WILL analyze your computer and the info will be send back. Faceit is very intrusive by design and as such if a single player gets banned on client side, even if it's a manual overwatch-type ban, the cheat could be analyzed and everyone could get hit.

## SMAC \(SourceMod Anti-Cheat\)

SMAC is a plugin server owners can use to protect their servers more. It is used on community servers. Due to it, being server sided it can't detect that much. Aimbot above a certain FOV for example will get detected. Many cheats also bypass SMAC, they just restrict your FOV and some other features, the same way it is done in Aimstep.
\(I think it can detect more than just Aimbot above I think it was 40+ FOV but dunno --TODO\)
