# Linux and macOS cheats

Despite most cheat providers only provide their cheat software on Windows, there are still some open-source solutions for linux and macOS players. However keep in mind that these cheats would require the user, which is you to compile on your own. So it is recommend that you should have some experiences on computers before doing so.

Also you should be noticed that these open-source solutions usually dosen't come with a good reslover and rage aimbot for rage cheating, so just try avoid rage cheating on macOS and linux.

## Linux

Due to the different architchure deisgn compared to Windows, it makes VAC being limited to work as the same effective as on Windows. Thus this could allow a lot of cheats still going strong after years of inactive development.

However as mentioned from github, some users have reported that the cheat might be detected, so other it is recommend to use other active public forks.

## macOS

Due to macOS's security features, it is difficult for cheat developers to code a cheat on macOS, however this also applies to VAC, which is the same as linux, are being limited too.

ButOSX is technically not a "Cheat software", but instead a software base forked from the discontiuned "Microwave" cheat. This could allow other cheat developers to work on it. It is the only public project that is in active development. If you are interested in using macOS for CSGO cheating, you should follow on this project.
