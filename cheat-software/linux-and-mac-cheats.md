# Linux and macOS cheats

Despite most of the cheat providers only providing their cheat software for Windows, there are still some open-source solutions for Linux and macOS players. However keep in mind that these cheats would require the user, which is you, to compile the cheat on your own. So it is recommend that you should have some experiences in reading before doing so.

Also you should have noticed that these open-source solutions usually doesn't come with a good resolver and a rage aimbot with features required for competitive rage cheating, so just try to avoid rage cheating on macOS and Linux.

## Linux

Valve's VAC team do not actively work on detecting cheats on macOS or Linux. Therefore, there are many cheats still undetected after years of inactive development.

[gamesneeze](https://github.com/seksea/gamesneeze) \(not to be confused with gamesense, which only available on Windows\) is a Linux cheat with legit and rage features available. It is still in active development and will happily take pull requests for improvements.

[Fuzion](https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion) is a Linux cheat that is modified from AimTux, another CS:GO cheat that was no longer maintained. It has legit and rage features available. However as mentioned from GitHub, some users have reported that the cheat might be detected, so it is recommend to use other active public forks, like [MissedIT](https://github.com/HackerPolice/MissedIT).

## macOS

Due to macOS's security features, it is difficult for cheat developers to code a cheat on macOS, however this also applies to VAC, which it's functionality is limited due to the same reason.

[ButOSX](https://github.com/Lyceion/ButOSX) is technically not a "Cheat software", but instead is a software base that could allow other cheat developers to work on it. It is the only public project that is in active development and supports injecting on M1 chips. If you are interested in using macOS for CS:GO cheating, you should follow this project.

// TODO NEED MORE INFORMATION ON THESE CHEATS. THEY MIGHT BE LEGIT, PASTES, OR FALSE INFORMATION
