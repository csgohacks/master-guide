## Closet

Closet cheating takes skill, before anyone dares to start closet cheating I suggest they first learn the mechanics of the game. Please do take time to learn crosshair placement, movement, recoil control, and a bit of gamesense.

## Peaking and Crosshair Placement

The definition of crosshair placement is when the player positions his/her crosshair to headshot level while peaking. It is crucial when trying to closet, since players can determine whether you are hacking or not. It takes a bit of time to memorise the placements in each corner and in each map, but after a few days of playing clean you will get the hang of it.

![A pretty common crosshair placement when peaking A Site in Dust 2, which is corsshair is always at the screen's middle, which is whre other player's head located](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/769491189050255925/985DC84FE63DC7135B840592B9E64430B8ED6971/)


A tip when peaking an angle is to jiggle peak/shoulder peak. This type of peaking gives you info about the whereabouts of the player without exposing yourself to them. Also, when there is an AWPer scoped in and holding an angle, you can shoulder peak to trigger their shot, and when they do, peak properly and attack them while they are waiting for the AWP bullet to reload or switch to another pistol. 

Not to mention, do not look at the ground and put your corsshair to other players when you saw one. This is a free giveway to overwatchers.

## Movement

Movement is important is general, but even more when closet cheating.

Movement consists of two parts: Strafing, and bhopping \(bunny hopping\)

Strafing is the act of pressing the left/right keys on your keyboard \(usually A and D\) and moving your mouse in order to gain spead while mid air. The best way I would suggest improving your strafing skills is to hop in surfing servers and learn how to surf. 

Bhopping is when the player jumps, and right before landing jumps again consistently without hitting the ground. Bhopping is usually used in order to gain speed, but in order to do so, the player must combine strafing and bhopping so that his or her speed will be consistent and fast. [Nadeking has a good tutorial on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwt2j8toi4s) There are a lot of  community servers that are hosting bhop maps, which you can take some time to improve your bhop skills, or even make a name on it. However, the best way is to practice on offical servers since most bhop servers are running at 128 tickrate while offical servers are only at 64 tick, which makes bhopping more harder.

If you want to learn improve your movement skills, you can find some community servers that is running kz maps.

## RCS and Recoil Control

When closeting, I highly advice you to not use RCS as it is very obvious to other players or overwatchers. There are many workshop maps that help you learn recoil patterns, such as [Mr. uLLeticaL™-S- map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847) or [Yprac's map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1365781615). Also, cetrain cheat providers have a "recoil crosshair". However, if you really cannot do without rcs I suggest to go with: _50.0 on X axis_ 60.0 on Y axis.

## Visuals

For visuals, it is up to personal favourite. However I suggest newcomers do not use any visual assistance (ESP thorugh walls), since you will automitaclly aim to them through walls, which will look extremely obvious. I suggest using Visable charms is already enough. Once you've build up experience without visual assistance, you can try turn on ESP. This might sounds ruin the purpose of cheating, but this is what it takes to make yourself look like a good player. It is this or that.

## Map knowledge
Map knowledge helps you to become a good player, without doubt. Without map knowledge, you have no idea what should you do in different situations. If you want to learn about maps, [here](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413) is a good collection of maps that you should take some time learn about the nade spots (even you have gernade helper), prefire spots, etc.

## Conclusion
If you want to be the next zhun/woke/whoever 'professional' high performance CS player, you should at least take some time to learn about maps, gun spraying, movement, remember, cheats are only "assists" your skills in legit cheating scene.
