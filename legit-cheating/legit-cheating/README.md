# Legit Cheating

## Legit Cheating
When you chooses to legit cheating, which means you have behave like other players,
## Some features you should use:

* Radar hack: Radar hack is better than regular ESP because it allows you to expect players, but not exactly where they are.

* Sound ESP: Sound ESP is much better than regular ESP because you only see it if the player is making noise. This means you know a player is there, however don't peek directly onto their head because the sound isn't that precise and it can be blatant.

* Charms: Charms makes enmeny players more visable and helps you to aim at them more quicker, but this is up to personal favourite.
  
* Gernade helper: Gernade helper helps you to throw gernades in different spots. Some cheats have this feature built in (Novolinehook-require user set up, spirthack), while others requires a lua to achieve this job. (Aimware, onetap, etc)
  
## Lose rounds!

Voluntarily die against bad players! In rounds where you're up by a handful, lose. In 14-14 rounds, it's okay to go a little harder. Lose unimportant rounds.

## Practice movement!

This is why people call you out most of the time. Silver movement, Global aim. Just hack barely enough to win at your rank. No more.

## High-rank matches

## Don't rage! 
If there is someone actually cheating, don't care about them. Even you've toggled your blatant config, your trust factor still go low and you will face even more ragers at the end, it just dosen't worth the price of winning one round and facing more cheaters.
