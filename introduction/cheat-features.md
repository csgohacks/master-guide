## Cheat features

* Aimbot - An aimbot is a software tool that allow the player to shoot enemies without having to aim their weapon. In most cheat software there are two types of aimbot: Legit and rage aimbot. The legit aimbot will also provide a smoothing function, which determines the speed of the aimbot moves the aim to the enemy's head or any other selected hitbox. As for a rage aimbot, it just behaves like a general aimbot, but it does immediately snap to the enemy's head.

* Triggerbot - Helps you to shoot towards an enemy when the enemy is located at cheater's crosshair. Usually comes with a delay function to let the user choose the delay when the triggerbot will shoot.

* Hitbox priority - In general, a playermodel hitbox is divided into different parts to the playermodel, in order to calculate the damage from the player

* Recoil Control System \(RCS\) - Helps you control the recoil of the gun. Some cheats also comes with a standalone RCS, what it means is that the RCS will not be affected by the aimbot.

* Anti-Aim \(AA\) - Also known as "Spinbot" by normal CS players. In CSGO, a viewangle is made from 3 basic elements:
  * Pitch \(Rotation along the X axis\)
  * Yaw   \(Rotation along the Y axis\)
  * Roll  \(Rotation along the Z axis\)

As we mentioned before, the way a aimbot \(What we are talking about here is rage aimbot\) works is by moving your crosshair to the enemy's head. So how anti-aim works, is to modify the angle of the playermodel's head by editing the values in pitch, yaw or roll, so that the aimbot will need to calculate the angle of the enemy's head, causing the chances of getting hit will be lower. One of the popular anti-aim, which is used to be spinbot, is achieved by modifying the yaw angle from -180 to 180 in one second, causing the playermodel looks like spinning. However nowadays the most common type of anti-aim are emotion \(45 degrees\) on pitch with static desync or jitter.

* Legit Anti-Aim - Legit anti-aim is similar to anti-aim, but with a smaller angle. It is achieved by using desync to a maximum of 58 degrees. Thus the playermodel will still look like normal, but the real hitbox is being shifted to a different angle. Also, most cheat provides also use a LBY breaker in order to achieve 118 degrees of legit anti-aim.

* Silent aim - Silent aim will allow you to freely move your character without having to look to the enemy and not snapping your corsshair onto the enmeny's head instantly. In the past, there was also a server-side silent-aim, which means other players will also see you are not snapping onto other player's head. However that was patched, and now there is only client-side silent aim available, which means in overwatch or demo, they will see you snap onto other player's head instantly.

* Spread / NoSpread - All weapons have spread in CSGO. So what NoSpread does is to remove all the bullet spread in the game, no matter when you are jumping, walking or running. It is only available in community servers.

* LBY - A short term for lower body yaw.

* Desync -

* Resolver - The resolver in a cheat, tries to calculate where an enemy's real head is. This can be really hard because some cheats got a decent AA which makes it harder for the resolver to figure out where to shoot.

* Backtrack - An exploit which allows you to shoot at where a certain player was and still hit them. Usually is configured in ticks or ms, with a maximum of 400ms.

In CSGO, in order to reduce latency between client and the server, a tick system is designed. What it does is the client will collect all the local data, compressed it as a tick and send it to the server. Then the server collects the ticks from different client in a specified time limit \(which is 64 tick in official valve servers while some community server servers will set to 128 tick.\), then send the calculated result to the clients. Thus the client is always several ticks ahead from the server, the tick which is used to determine the hitbox is the first tick chocked from the client. And what backtrack does is by broadcast a history recorded tick to the server. This is also used in fake angles, which is achieved by broadcasting a fake tick to other client from the server, however this got patched in 2018.

* FakeLag - Will let the players look like freezing between frames. It works similar to using a lag switch.

* ESP - Also know as "walls /wall hacking / visual assistance". Which allows the user to see through a player whether it is an enemy or an teammate through various obstacle such as walls, smoke, etc. Most ESP provide multiple options for the user to set up, such as shading the playermodel, types of ESP, or what object should be seen through.

* ASUS Walls - A cheat feature which allows you to see through specific walls. It was achieved by exploiting a driver provided by ASUS, which allows to control the transparency of specific materials / textures.

* Fast stop - This allows the player to stop close to immediately.

* Fast duck/unlimited duck - exploit that breaks crouch stamina

* Name stealer - Will allow the player to steal other player's name, so that the player will not get kicked. Mostly useful when a cheater is raging in casual gamemodes or community servers.

* Inventory unlock: In competitive mode, you're not allowed to change your weapon choice once the match was started. With inventory unlock, you can access the inventory panel while the match is being played.

* Smoothing - affects the speed at which the aimbot aims to the enemy

* RCS - recoil control system
