These are the terms that are commonly used in the CS:GO cheating community:

## Cheat Software-related

* P2C - Cheat software that requires the user to pay for it.
* F2C - Cheat software that don't requires the user to pay for it.
* Paste - Cheats that use code which isn't written by them. However most of them behave quite bad and the chances of getting detected by anti-cheat software are very high. Also some scammers would use them as a base to scam people. However people also use this term in order to insult a cheat provider.
* Crack - Cheats that used to be paid but now being accessible for free because of a vulnerability found in their security.
* Config - The configuration for the cheat. Most of the cheats in CS:GO provide a lot of features for the user to set up. A configuration file allows the user to load up pre-configurated settings to the cheat, reduces the time to set up the cheat all over again.
* Lua/js - Some cheat providers also allow their community to create some scripts in order to let the cheat behave how the user-wanted. This could allow the user to make the cheat more flexible. Most of the scripts are written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), however some cheat providers provide a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) API, therefore there are also scripts are written in JavaScript \(JS for short\).

## Cheating styles

* Closet - Cheaters who tries to hide up their cheat to a maximum level in order to not get called out from other people. Mostly they will only turn on a few features, such as only toggle up a little bit of aim-assist, or a high smooth value of legit aimbot, sometimes they will also toggle up airstrafe and auto bunnyhop.
* Legit - Which is similar to a closet cheater, who tries to play like a normal player. However the difference with closet cheaters are they will turn on more features compared to closet cheaters, such as ESP.
* Blatant - Cheaters who turns on features that other players will notice that the cheater is cheating such as triggerbot, esp, or somteimes rage aimbot. They will have a higher chance of getting banned.
* Rage - Cheaters will turn on most of the features that the cheat has available in order to win a match by any cost, such as Anti-Aim, rage aimbot, esp, etc. Mostly they will receive a ban in a day or in a week, depends on how long overwatch takes or the cheat gets detected by the anti-cheat software.

## In game

* HvH - A short term for "Hack-versus-Hack". In these cases, the cheaters on both sides will load up their rage configuration in order to win the match. Mostly seen on non-prime level 2 accounts.
* Legit HvH - Simlar to HvH, but in this case, the cheater on both sides will only toggle their blatant configuration, since they don't want to have the risk of a ban \(Despite the chances of getting banned on legit HvH are very high\). Mostly seen on non-prime or prime MM.
* P / p100 - A term to represent something is very good, near perfection. For example, when a cheater typed "hitting p" in chat, this means his ragebot always hits the target, running nearly perfect.
