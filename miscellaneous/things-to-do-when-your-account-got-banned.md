## VAC bans
Before reading this page, you should check out the ![types of game bans at here](/introduction/game-bans.md), which will cover most types of VAC bans. In short when your account is banned, you cannot:
* Play on VAC-secured servers in the game you have been banned,
* Cannot trade items on the game you have been banned.

## What can I do for it?
In short, there is nothing you can do when a game account got banned. However, you can still use a ![batch file](https://pastebin.com/KBCAf2Xt)  which can helps you to remove all the steam account's data on your PC.

If you are raging with expensive inventory, it is highly recommend to transfer your inventory to a unlinked account.

## Final words
Always remember, there is no such "Undetectable cheat." Therefore, always prepare that chances are you will going to be banned by VAC when raging in VAC-secured servers.
