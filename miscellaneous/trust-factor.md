# Trust Factor

## Disclaimer 
This guide only show the results of serval individuals, and we are not going discuss how this works or suspecting it. Most of the experience here (ie: bring accounts back from a bad trust factor to a high trust factor.)  

Also keep in mind that some accounts can NOT be brought back easily from a low trust factor to a high trust factor, they absolutely will not only take half an hour. However, you CAN bring it around with the methods below

These methods were tested across roughly 15 accounts (individual accounts), and 2 other accounts on a friends machine to rule out IP/HWID shenanigans. I used players with known perfect (or close to) trust factors, and the party warning, to test out the current state of my trust. 

- THESE HAVE ALL BEEN PRIME ACCOUNTS, IF SOMEONE HAS VARYING RESULTS ON A NON PRIME I'D LIKE TO KNOW. Valve is constantly updating trust factor, so by the time you're reading this, it could be out of date.

I based the methods I chose mainly from the trust factor portion from this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhK8lUfIlc And running with the idea of how valve would logically determine a ' positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community.

## Methods to increase your trust factor
* Put money in your steam account: This is by far the quickest way to spike trust factor. This is mainly for bought accounts with nothing on them. Some people have reported instant jumps from red to yellow with forking over $7 USD to random items: skins, games, or even your steam profile items, etc.

In example: A player was on an account that only raged on 3 games with, and had been reported within one low trust factor game. So it can be assumed that the player's trust factor wasn't that 'low' on the red trust spectrum. Then the player paid $5 in skins and then start a party match, and ... it went yellow. So it can be concluded that putting money will 100% raise trust.

HOWEVER, this doesn't work on a linear scale, and we assume that valve has a logical approach to it. What does it means putting money will not always increase your trust factor. Take the aobve example. The player have already putting 5 USD into his steam account, causing his account's trust factor increased from red to yellow. However when the user decided putting another $7 into his steam account, it will not make him back into green, and neither did another $14 (now 3x in th account's first jump), so it can be assumed there is a base level in which money can raise from, in situations where the valve algorithm is using that as a decisive reason as to why your account is dodgy when you're reported. If you're on an account where you've spent thousands, and THEN dropped trust, we would be interested to know if injecting more cash fixes this.

NO CASH -- HIGH TRUST -- HALF AN HOUR - 2 HOURS (unless you're a maaaaaaassive shit-cunt, sorry, it will take longer).
I use any combo of these methods, and then do a game and frag poorly, it has worked every time on accounts with shit-cunty behavior of around 10 games, hard core raging over a massive game span is going to be a lot harder. TODO: What is this?

STEAM DISCUSSIONS - I haven't really ever heard this one said along with the 'get commends' ect. But it seeeems to be one of the most consistent, whatever else i do, i always use this. This is because it's quick and easy and furthermore goes along with valve's statement "All you need to do is be a positive member of the CS:GO and Steam community. "

So literally being a 'positive' member of the community by contributing to the community tab- makes sense and the discussions is the easiest way to do this. Do NOT spam the discussions with total nonsense, there is a constant Jannie presence there, but don't stress too much... You can literally put zero effort into your responses. Just post random shit that is kind of related or reply with the first thing that pops into your head. Not sure if it matters, but personally I avoid one word responses. Don't stress about the cool down in between sending whatever-amount of messages... you should be doing the other methods below while you shit all over the discussion board with vaguely related shit to the random Peruvians posting questions in general about really specific games.

* Idle wizard - I call this my trust factor farmer, this is my least conclusive trust factor method in this section, but i cant leave it out because i literally always use it, because it costs me nothing.

I just have it on and running while i'm doing whatever else, while i walk my dog or whatever if I'm not trying to PUMP UP trust in rapid time. It's just a way for you to be in another game aside from cs:go.

My logic is that if you're on an account just to cheat you wont be playing other games, so a game that you won't get an idle status on- while costing next to no gpu/cpu usage- is a pretty good deal.

PLAY DA GAME - ... without getting reported... For some people this might be hard, especially if you're on a DMG account and you never graduated silver, BUT, i have never ever gotten my trust back to green, without first playing a game.

This is done after/during the above methods. Generally i will close CSGO, launch idle wizard while i post some steam discussions, re-open csgo, search... do more steam discussions, while i have idle wizard running. Don't worry about winning, don't grief, if you refuse to absolutely play without cheats, have radar on every FEW rounds, not all the time, and not at the start of the game.

People will usually have made their mind up if you're cheating by the first few time you're caught off guard going around a corner. Same with aimbot; just don't have it on all the time, but ideally you don't cheat at all. Just call out, or type friendly or whatever. don't fucking AWP your team mate's head off because he called you trash, deal with it.

2 games seems to be the general ballpark for accounts with pretty low accounts (as in accounts that haven't just gone into low trust fresh, accounts that have probably been reported within low trust itself). In silver you can probably just put on some music and never use mic, people don't really call there anyway. If you've been a lil closet bitch in MG+ and that's why you want to raise your trust, at least learn what counter strafing/peeking is, otherwise you'll go back down anyways. Alt tab while you're dead, chill out and don't let the games get to you.

DO NOT P QUEUE with this method- at least i didn't, not when i had my trust raise anyways, do what you want.

If your account is uber fucked and after 3 games it's still dogshit, try the above methods more, outside of playing more games and have idle wizard while you sleep/work/school.

SIDENOTE: could be coincidence, but have tried custom games (arms race/death match) and noticed no improvement whilst jumping into an actual competitive game made me shoot right back up.

#2: time works- as in spending a long time outside of cs:go-  but dodgy accounts with cs as their only played game (accounts valve would have a reason to suspect is a botted account), probably doesn't, I'm not 100% sure of this but my experiences and others seems to come in ling with this. I am 100% sure that time in general does improve more legit accounts though. 

#3:team killing will FUCK your trust, hard. 
## Myths when increasing your trust factor.

* Using commend bots: There are some people claimed that using commend bots to commend on your account can gain your trust factor, which isn't the case. The only thing it achieves is make you look stupid in low trust games.

Despite of that, commend bots are still useful if you are on a high trust factor and when trying to be a professional player.

* Idling in CSGO matches (Deathmatch/ War games):  Another common myth on increasing your trust factor is idling in various non-competitive matches can gain back your trust factor. However idling in cs:go in general doesn't work, despite we believed this myth comes from the fact that trust factor deteriorates over time in some cases.

Valve is constantly updating their shit, by the time you're reading this, it could be out of date.
